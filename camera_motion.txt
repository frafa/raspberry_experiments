sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

We start by removing libraries that may conflict with the newer packages. These may or may not already exist on your copy of Raspbian.

sudo apt-get remove libavcodec-extra-56 libavformat56 libavresample2 libavutil54

Download and install the following packages by inserting the following commands into the terminal.

wget https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki/precompiled/ffmpeg_3.1.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i ffmpeg_3.1.1-1_armhf.deb

Now we need to install the following packages. We will need these as the Motion software relies on them.

sudo apt-get install curl libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjpeg-dev libx264-142 libavcodec56 libavformat56 libmysqlclient18 libswscale3 libpq5

With those packages installed we can now grab the latest version of the motion software and install it. To do this run the following commands

wget https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases/download/release-4.0.1/pi_jessie_motion_4.0.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i pi_jessie_motion_4.0.1-1_armhf.deb

- Raspbian Stretch
First, install the following packages. This command will work both on the full and lite version of Raspbian Stretch.

sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient18 libpq5 libavcodec57  libavformat57 libavutil55 libswscale4

Next, download the Motion deb file from the GitHub and install it using the dpkg command.

sudo wget https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases/download/release-4.0.1/pi_stretch_motion_4.0.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i pi_stretch_motion_4.0.1-1_armhf.deb

That's all you need to do before moving on to configuring Motion so that it will run on your Pi.

- Configuring Motion
1. Now we need to make some edits to the configuration file (motion.conf)

sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf

2. Find the following lines and change them to the following.

daemon on
stream_localhost off
Note: Change the following two lines from on to off if you're having issues with the stream freezing whenever motion occurs.

output_pictures off
ffmpeg_output_movies off
Optional (Don't include the text in brackets)

stream_maxrate 100 (This will allow for real-time streaming but requires more bandwidth & resources)
framerate 100 (This will allow for 100 frames to be captured per second allowing for smoother video)
width 640 (This changes the width of the image displayed)
height 480 (This changes the height of the image displayed)

3. Now we need to setup up the daemon. First, we need to edit the motion file.

sudo nano /etc/default/motion

4. Find the following line and change it to the following:

start_motion_daemon=yes

5. Once you're done, simply save and exit by pressing ctrl+x then y.

6. Now make sure the camera is connected and run the following line:

sudo service motion start

7. If you need to stop the service, simply run the following command:

sudo service motion stop
8. Now you should be able to check out the Webcam Stream at the IP address of our Pi so in your browser go to the following address:

192.168.1.103:8081

9. If the webpage isn't loading, try restarting the service.

sudo service motion restart
